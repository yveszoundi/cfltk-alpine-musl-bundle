/tl;dr/ [[https://github.com/MoAlyousef/cfltk][cfltk]] [[https://musl.libc.org/][musl]] bundles for [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][fltk-rs]].

* What is this?

This is a set of pre-built libraries for [[https://github.com/MoAlyousef/cfltk][cfltk]] targetting [[https://musl.libc.org/][musl libc]].

By default there are only =cfltk= bundles available for systems with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/][glibc]].


* How to use this?

*Please remember that this is only for musl-based systems.*

At the root of your =fltk-rs= rust project, run the following command:

#+begin_src sh
  CFLTK_BUNDLE_PREFIX=https://github.com/yveszoundi/cfltk-musl-lib/releases/latest/download cargo build
#+end_src

* What is available?

Please visit the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/cfltk-musl-lib/releases][releases page]] for downloads (64-bit: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64][amd64/x86_64]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][arm64/aarch64]]).

* How to build this?

There's a GitHub Actions workflow definition at [[./github/workflows/build.yml]], but sadly the process is killed for =arm64=.

GitHub is probably killing the =arm64= build due to CPU and RAM usage: all that is running via =QEMU= emulation...

TBD find a workaround or publish a =Dockerfile= for local usage.
